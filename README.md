## Active Directory Auditing and Enumeration
Invoke-ADEnum is an auditing and enumeration tool designed to automate the collection of information from an Active Directory environment.

One of the features of Invoke-ADEnum is its ability to generate an Active Directory Audit Report in HTML format. Whether performing security assessments, compliance audits, or general Active Directory enumeration tasks, the report will provide a detailed overview of the Active Directory infrastructure in an easy-to-navigate layout.

**NOTE:** By clicking on the tables' titles, you can generate and download a CSV version of the results. Additionally, you have the option to export the entire HTML report in XLSX format by clicking on "Active Directory Audit" at the top of the page. The XLSX export will include a separate sheet for each table of findings.

**If you find Invoke-ADEnum valuable and use it in your work, please consider giving it a star. Your support motivates me to continue improving and maintaining this project**
